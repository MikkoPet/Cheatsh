            <h2>Maquettage</h2>
            <p>
                Before starting to code, a website goes through 
                a few conception stages to identify what to go towards: 
            </p>

            <h3>
               ZONING
            </h3>

            <p>
                Blocks to define where things go, roughly. <br>
                Overall layout of the website
            </p>

            <h3>
                WIREFRAME
             </h3>
 
             <p>
                Builds on <em>ZONING</em> <br>  
                Adds placeholder text and images  <br>
                Allows to give an idea of the VISUALS of the website <br> 
             </p>
             <h3>
                MOCKUP
             </h3>
 
             <p>
                Creates a rough version of the website, without code <br> 
                Refines the decisions of previous steps  <br>
                Inserts the assets of the project  <br>
             </p>
             <h3>
                MAQUETTE
             </h3>
 
             <p>
                Makes the mockup navigable  <br>
                Gives an idea of the features and functions  <br>
                Allows for rough testing of the links between pages  <br>
             </p>
             <h3>
                PROTOTYPE
             </h3>
 
             <p>
                a sort of v.00 of the website  <br>
                CODED  <br>
                For testing and adjusting to user feedback  <br>

            <h2>The Client's needs</h2>

            <p>
                How to define the client's need? <br>
                When faced with an indecisive uninspired client, there are a couple questions
                that can orient the discussion towards concrete decisions.
            </p>

            <h5>
                What is the website's purpose?
            </h5>
            <p>
                Is it a shop, a gallery, a forum? The website's type will dictate its contents,
                features, and other decisions.
            </p>

            <h5>
                What is the target audience of the website?
            </h5>
            <p>
                Age, gender, occupation... <br>
                Who uses the website influences how it's structured. <br>
                For exemple, a website for the elderly may feature bigger text, on for teenagers
                will have more trendy 'dynamic' design...
            </p>

            <h5>
                What services will the website provide?
            </h5>
            <p>
                A service likely means a FEATURE! <br>
                Highlight which ones are absolutely MANDATORY! <br>
                Point the client towards the right direction based on what type of site was
                identified in the first question.
            </p>

            <h5>
                Do you have references of other websites you like?
            </h5>
            <p>
                What are the things they like, the ones they want something similar to? <br>
                <strong>Failing to provide exemples themselves</strong>, they'll enjoy being 
                provided with a portfolio of potential sites matching their needs, in different designs,
                to point out what they like and don't.
            </p>

            <h5>
                Do you already have an existing website?
            </h5>
            <p>
                If so, what do you want to keep from it, what do you want to change?
            </p>

            <h5>
                How often will this site need updates, and who will handle them?
            </h5>
            <p>
                This will inform how to structure the website to make it more or less easy to edit <br>
                Will it need an interface for the clientside? <br>
            </p>

            <h5>
                How many interfaces do you want your website to display on?
            </h5>
            <p>
                AND which one's the most important? Laptop, mobile?
            </p>

            <h5>
                Does your company have a graphical chart to follow?
            </h5>
            <p>
                Colour schemes, fonts... even if only from a logo. <br>
                If not, what kind of aesthetics do you enjoy? Something more traditional, organic,
                modern... <br>
                Can link back to the exemples provided in question 4.
            </p>

            <h5>
                Budget and time of execution...
            </h5>
            <p>
                Simply asking the budget heads on can lead to undiplomatic situations... <br>
                Giving an estimate cost is already a better way to open that conversation, especially
                if already considering negociations, try offering a few different price-points of the
                website with reduction of some superfluous features, so the client can pick which is most
                adapted to their needs.
            </p>

            <h2>Ergonomy Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    Things to keep in mind for the user's ease:
                </p>

                    <h4>
                        Clarity and space
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Clogging the space will make the website unreadable, and muddle out all 
                        information. <br>
                        <strong>Instead</strong> try to keep things minimal and spaced out, so the 
                        user's eye can roam without strain. <br>
                        Outdated, redundant, or pointless contents should be removed to not
                        overwhelm the user with too much at once.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Consistency
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Keeping the different pages cohesive helps with clarity as well, as the user 
                        doesn't have to "relearn" where to find things each time.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Hierarchy
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Use organised sizing to highlight important pieces of information and keep 
                        everything in a consistent hierarchy. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Contrast
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Between sizes, colours, elements... Contrast drives the eye to important elements.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Fluid Navigation
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Menues should be easely accessible at all times, that way the user can move between 
                        pages without having to first look for HOW to move between pages. <br>
                        It also helps to provide the user with information of WHERE in the website they are 
                        currently, through titles and/or breadcrumb trails.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Time is of the essence...
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Be it in load time, or navigation time! The user is impatient. <br>
                        Keep the website light, optimise it and reduce bloat for the pages to load
                        as fast as possible. <br>
                        As mentioned before, navigation also needs to be quick, be it between 
                        pages or within one page. <br>
                        When it comes to browsing, some refer to a <strong>3 clicks rule</strong>, 
                        meaning that from the HOMEPAGE, it shouldn't take more than 3 clicks for the 
                        user to find what they're looking for.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Dynamism
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        A website with relevant animations will enhance the user experience and helps guiding
                        them through. <br>
                        BUT it's crucial to not overdo it, and lose your user to visual noise. <br>
