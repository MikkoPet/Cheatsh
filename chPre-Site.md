## MAQUETTAGE

Before starting to code, a website goes through a few conception stages to identify what to go towards:

1. ZONING  
Blocks to define where things go, roughly.  
Overall layout of the website

2. WIREFRAME  
Builds on *ZONING*  
Adds placeholder text and images  
Allows to give an idea of the VISUALS of the website  

3. MOCKUP  
Creates a rough version of the website, without code  
Refines the decisions of previous steps  
Inserts the assets of the project  

4. MAQUETTE  
Makes the mockup navigable  
Gives an idea of the features and functions  
Allows for rough testing of the links between pages  

5. PROTOTYPE  
a sort of v.00 of the website  
CODDED  
For testing and adjusting to user feedback  

### What tools for these steps?

Popular tools for mockups:

- Moqups
    - FREE web app

- Balsamiq
    - One ofthe oldest mockup tools
    - VERY low fidelity

- Mockplus
    - wide library
    - responsive
    - exports are PAID

- UXPin
    - EXPENSIVE
    - VERY complete

- Adobe XD  
    - Powerful, interractive and user friendly
    - Links automatically with other Adobe Products

- Figma
    - Real time collaboration
    - Cloud based

- Sketch  
    - Centered around DEV
    - Lots of tools

- Lunacy
    - [Reunaud's](https://github.com/RenaudBaussart) recommandation
    - User friendly, & free 

## BEST PRACTICES

Steps to rapidly conceive a good maquette:

1. Create an interraction map
    - retraces a simulated user experience, where will they go, what will they look for, what will they click
2. Don't be afraid to make paper maquettes to quickly freehand the maps
3. focus on optimising the hierarchy of information FROM the mockup stage

## YOU vs THE CLIENT

### Define a client's wants

1. What is the website's purpose? Is it a shop/an info site/etc...

2. What is the target audience? Age/Gender/Occupation/etc...  
    - ->will inform choices in design/architecture | ex: bigger elements for elderly, 'trendy' and phoneapp like design for teens with links to socmed...
3. What services (=features) will this website provide? Which ones are MANDATORY. 
    - Will there be only payment? Forms? Ask typical features of the type of site defined in question 1
1. Do you have references of other websites you like, and want something similar to?
    - failing, have exemples of different kind of websites in the genre they want and ask which ones they like, which they prefer...
8. Do you have an existing website, if so what do you want to keep/change.
6. How often will this website need updates, and who will be in charge of making them? (=define ease of editing)
7. How many interfaces do you want your website to display on? Computer/Mobile phone/TV/Smart watches...
8. Do you have a company visual chart to follow? Colour scheme, fonts etc...   
    - If not, what aesthetic do you like, what colours, font types, something more traditional? futuristic? Can link back to the exemples provided in 4.
2. What budget and timeline do you have?   
    - **OR** from the defined needs and wants of the client, give an estimated cost, and discuss what can be added/removed/changed to fit into their budget, 
    - **BETTER YET** provide them with a couple of different prices possibilities built on their needs/wants from the get go, to have them understand the vague idea of what different scales cost

## ERGONOMY RULES

Things to keep in mind for the user's ease:

#### Clarity and Space

Clogging the space will make the website unreadable, and muddle out the information. Keep things minimal and spaced out. 

#### Consistency

Keeping the different pages cohesive helps with clarity too, as the user doesn't have to relearn where to find things each time.

#### Prioritisation

Use organised sizing to highlight more important pieces of information and keep things in a hierarchy. Pointless contents should be removed, as the users will get overwhelmed if there is too much to see at once.

#### Contrast

Between elements, between colours

#### Navigation

Menues should be easely accessible, so the user can move between pages without having to look for it. The user should also be able to tell where in the website they are (titles, breadcrumb trail...+404 to let them know they got lost!!)

#### Time

Keep your website light, optimise it to not take too long and tire out your user. It should also be quick to navigate (some refer to the '3 clicks rule', from the home page, anything should be findable in 3 clicks)

#### Dynamism

A website with relevant animations will please the user, but don't overdo it else they'll get lost in the visual noise. That also includes FEEDBACKS which will help the user be aware of where they are, what they did, what worked etc... and reduce their confusions or doubts

### the goal is to

1. limit the time during which the user is LOOKING for things instead of browsing (=passive time)
2. be as intuitive as possible
3. make the content appear attractive
4.
